Streelife Test
Setup chosen
I assume that the focus of this test are the UI and the interactions rather than focus on the javascript manipulation so I decide to use ES6 instead of vanilla javascript for clarity of code.

Additionally, I introduce a set of tools really handy to speed up this development for the limited amount of time to do this development.

First, I took the freedom to use Webpack, WebpackDevServer, Redux in order to
deliver more in the UI area and manage state, store and persistency on this
test.
