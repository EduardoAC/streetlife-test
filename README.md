Streelife Test
Setup chosen
I assume that the focus of this test are the UI and the architecture rather than
focus on the javascript manipulation so I decide to use ES6 instead of vanilla
javascript for clarity of code over Redux framework to implement store.

Additionally, I introduce a set of tools really handy to speed up this
development for the limited amount of time to do this development.

In order to explain a bit of the project structure, I will start with the
concepts I used it:
- ITCSS is a architecture that helps with specificity and remove reduncdancy plus
potentially the application with the concept of component for React.
- Introduction of Color, Spacing and Font palette key for big projects, I probably
I need to review the application but I did as much I could to put in place
- Build a grid using Susy (set of tools for build grids) that make complete a whole
layout in less than half day.
- BEM methodology to provide a good UI architecture with block, elements and modifiers
- Introduce ESLINT as first approach to write better code and review small syntax errors.
